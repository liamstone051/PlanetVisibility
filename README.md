# Planet Visibility Map

Map to show where the planets are currently visible from around the world. 
Each ring shows where the planet appears at a specific altitude above the horizon.
The outermost ring starts at 0° (planet is along the horizon) and each contour represents an additional 10°, up to the center which marks the zenith at 90° (directly overhead).
Updates every minute.

Includes the moon and all planets in the solar system (as well as pluto!)

Programmed in Python using plotly, the R files are from a previous attempt that I kept for referencing when switching into Python.

Extensive checking was done with Stellerium, feel free to check for yourself to confirm it works properly.
